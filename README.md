# Rick & Morty App

## About the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The website is made up of two pages:

- Main page where we can see a list of all the characters with general information about them. There's also a search filter by characterâ€™s name.

- Individual page where we can see in detail the information of each character, so they can have access to all their data. This page can be shared with a unique link.

Both pages can be visualized from a mobile phone and a computer.

The information is obtained from this API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

We have unit tests and integration tests where we mock the data with msw

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
